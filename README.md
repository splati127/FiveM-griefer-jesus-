# FiveM-griefer-jesus-
This is a simple FiveM script that randomly spawns jesus with a Railgun running towards you and may shoot you if you misbehave. 

Preview: https://streamable.com/afi846

If you use ESX you can activate it in server.lua for using the "/grieferjesus [id]" command (only works when player is in group "superadmin")

I know this is stupid and useless, but still I thought it may be funny and released it. 

Credits for the PED fully go to NotOfTheWorld, NotCrunchyTaco, NModds, SilkTeam for creating it and releasing it here: "https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/jesus-christ-mod", I just converted one of the PEDs to FivM so I can use it for this script...

Thanks all ^^
